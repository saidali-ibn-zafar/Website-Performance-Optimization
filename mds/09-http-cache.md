# HTTP Caching for Improved Performance

The HTTP Cache is an effective way to improve load performance because it reduces unnecessary network requests. It's supported in all browsers and doesn't take too much work to set up.

## Cache-Control Configurations

- **Cache-Control: no-cache**
  - Use for resources that need to be revalidated with the server before every use.
  
- **Cache-Control: no-store**
  - Apply to resources that should never be cached locally or in intermediary caches.
  
- **Cache-Control: max-age=31536000**
  - Set for versioned resources that can be cached for a long duration (e.g., one year).

And the ETag or Last-Modified header can help you revalidate expired cache resources more efficiently.
