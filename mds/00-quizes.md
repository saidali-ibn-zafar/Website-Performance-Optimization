## Question
Which rule is faster to evaluate?

1. `h1 { font-size: 16px }`
2. `div p { font-weight: 12px }`
3. No difference!

## Answer
`h1 { font-size: 16px }`

## Explanation
### Specificity and Evaluation

1. **`h1 { font-size: 16px }`**:
   - This rule targets all `<h1>` elements directly.
   - The browser only needs to look for `<h1>` tags in the document.

2. **`div p { font-weight: 12px }`**:
   - This rule targets `<p>` elements that are descendants of `<div>` elements.
   - The browser needs to search for all `<div>` elements and then for each `<div>`, look for its descendant `<p>` elements.

### Performance

Evaluating a CSS rule that targets an element directly (like `h1`) is generally faster than evaluating a rule that targets a nested structure (like `div p`). This is because direct element targeting is simpler and requires less computational work than checking for descendant relationships in the DOM tree.

Therefore, the answer is:

**`h1 { font-size: 16px }` is faster to evaluate.**
